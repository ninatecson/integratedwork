<h2 style="color:indianred;"> What Is A Graph ?</h2>
<p style="color:indianred;">A graph is a structure consisting of a set of items in which some pairs of the objects are in some way "connected" in mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory. Each of the connected pairs of vertices is termed an edge, and the objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (sometimes called nodes or points) (also called link or line). A graph is typically portrayed as a group of dots or circles for the vertices, linked by lines or curves for the edges, in diagrammatic form. In discrete mathematics, graphs are one of the topics studied.<br>
Graphs form an essential part of Data Interpretation. You need to be aware of the different kinds of graphs to handle questions accurately.</p>

<h2 style="color:indianred;">Types Of Graphs :</h2>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Pie Chart/Circle Graph</b><br>
-  A circle graph is formed like a circle, as the name implies. It's divided into fractions that look like pie slices. A circle graph is sometimes known as a pie graph because of this.
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Bar Graph</b><br>
- A bar graph is a graph that uses bars to represent data. The bars can run vertically or horizontally. The information can be in the form of words or numbers.
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Line Graph</b><br>
- A line graph is a graph with points plotted on it. A line is formed by connecting these places.
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Histogram Graph</b><br>
- A histogram graph is a graphical representation of data that uses bars of different heights.
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Flowcharts</b><br>
- A flowchart is a diagram that depicts a process. Flowcharts are commonly used by businesses to illustrate all stages of a project. It aids in the deconstruction of the process and comprehension of the entire scenario.

<h2 style="color:indianred;"> Why Do We Use Graphs? Why Are They Important?</h2>
<p  style="color:indianred;"> Graphs and charts are <b>visuals that show relationships between data</b> and are intended to display the data in a way that is easy to understand and remember. People often use graphs and charts to demonstrate trends, patterns and relationships between sets of data.<br><br>
Data visualization gives us a clear idea of what the information means by giving it visual context through maps or graphs. This makes the <b>data more natural</b> for the human mind to comprehend and therefore makes it easier to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within large data sets.</p>

<h2 style="color:indianred;"> How Does This Help In Our Lives? </h2> 
<p style="color:indianred;"> In real life, graphs can be used in a variety of ways. A line graph in the shape of a straight line, for example, denotes a linear relationship between two quantities shown on the x- and y-axes. That would reveal whether one increases while the other drops, or whether both increase or decrease at the same time, as well as whether one increases more than the other.<br><br>
There are also bar graphs and circle graphs that indicate the relative magnitude of various elements at a glance. A bar graph, for example, may show the relative strength of the many communities that make up a town's population. A circle graph can represent the percentage of money spent on various household items over the course of a month.</p>
