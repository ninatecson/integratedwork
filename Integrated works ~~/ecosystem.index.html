<h2 style="color:indianred;"> What Is An Ecosystem ?</h2>
<p style="color:indianred;">An ecosystem is a geographical area in which plants, animals, and other species, as well as weather and topography, interact to generate a living bubble. Ecosystems comprise both biotic and abiotic elements, or living and nonliving components. Plants, animals, and other species are examples of biotic factors. Rocks, temperature, and humidity are examples of abiotic variables.<br><br>
Every aspect in an ecosystem, whether directly or indirectly, is dependent on every other factor. A change in the temperature of an ecosystem, for example, can have an impact on the plants that thrive there. Animals that rely on plants for food and shelter will either have to adjust to the changes or migrate to a different ecosystem.<br><br>
Ecosystems can range in size from enormous to small. Tide pools, or ponds left behind by the ocean as the tide recedes, are miniature ecosystems in themselves. Seaweed, a type of algae that produces food through photosynthesis, can be found in tide pools. Seaweed is eaten by herbivores like abalone. Other species in the tidal pool, such as clams or mussels, are eaten by carnivores like sea stars. The shifting level of ocean water affects tide pools. When the tide is in and the pool is full, some species, such as seaweed, thrive in an aquatic environment. Hermit crabs, for example, cannot live underwater and rely on the shallow pools left by low tides. In this way, the ecosystem's biotic components are reliant on abiotic forces.<sup>(credits to National Geographic)<sup> </p>

<h2 style="color:indianred;"> Types Of Ecosystems</h2>
<p style="color:indianred;"> Ecosystems are divided into two categories. The types and examples of ecosystems are shown below. 
<ol>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b> Natural Ecosystem</b> <br>
- A natural ecosystem is a biological environment that is formed organically in nature. Deserts, woods, meadows, lakes, mountains, ponds, rivers, and oceans are all included.
<li style="color:indianred;"><b> Man-made ecosystem </b> <br>
 – A man-made ecosystem is one that is developed and maintained by humans. It has an aquarium, crop fields, gardens, parks, and a zoo, among other things.

<h2 style="color:indianred;">The Environment's Parts Are Primarily Classified Into Two Categories.</h2>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Biotic environmen</b><br>
- Animals, birds, woods, insects, reptiles, and microorganisms such as algae, bacteria, fungi, and viruses are all part of the biotic environment.
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Abiotic environment</b><br>
– All non-living components, such as air, cloud, dust, land, mountains, rivers, temperature, humidity, water, water vapour, sand, and so on, are included in the abiotic environment.
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:indianred"> 
<h2 style="color:indianred;">Why Is The Environment Imortant?</h2>
<p style="color:indianred;">The environment has a significant impact on human health and the continuation of life on the planet. Earth is home to a variety of living species, and we are all reliant on it for food, air, water, and other necessities. As a result, it is critical for each of us to save and protect our environment.<sup>(credits to byjus)<sup></p>
