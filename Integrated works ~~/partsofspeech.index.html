<h2 style="color:indianred;"> Short History Recap </h2>
<p style="color:indianred;"> The ancient Greek grammarian Dionysius Thrax is credited with the idea of dividing words into discrete parts of speech. For a long time, the idea was somewhat universally acknowledged. It was eventually the subject of grand claims. The components of speech were described as "the foundation upon which the beautiful fabrick of the language stands" by an anonymous author in the 1733 book "The English Accidence," and John Stuart Mill believed they represented universal categories of human understanding.<sup>(credits to New York Times)</sup></p>

<h2 style="color:indianred;">The 8 Parts of Speech: Examples and Rules</h2>
<p style="color:indianred;">Every word in the English language is a part of speech. The role of a word in a sentence is referred to as "part of speech." These roles, like in any industry or TV production with an ensemble cast, were created to work together.</p>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Nouns</b>
<p style="color:indianred;">- A noun is a term that refers to a person, location, idea, or thing. Basically, anything that refers to a "thing," whether it's a basketball court, San Francisco, Cleopatra, or self-preservation, is a noun.<br><br>
-There are two sorts of nouns: common nouns and proper nouns. The terms "planet" and "game show" are examples of common nouns. Proper nouns, such as Jupiter and Jeopardy!, are unique names for specific things.</p>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Pronouns</b>
<p style="color:indianred;">- When the reader or listener understands which exact noun you're referring to, you use pronouns to replace it.<br><br>
"Jennifer was scheduled to be here at eight," you might reply, before adding, "she's always late; next time, I'll tell her to come a half-hour earlier."<br><br>
You swapped she and her for Jennifer's name three times in a row, and your statements remained grammatically correct.</p>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Adjectives</b>
<p style="color:indianred;">- Adjectives are words that are used to characterize nouns. Consider your favourite movie. What would you say to a friend who hasn't seen it?<br><br>
The film could be described as humorous, fascinating, well-written, or suspenseful. You're utilizing adjectives when you use these terms to describe the movie. An adjective can (but does not have to) come before the noun it describes (I have a black dog). Adjectives are sometimes used at the end of a statement (my dog is black).</p>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Verbs</b>
<p style="color:indianred;"> - Go! Be extraordinary! As quickly as you can! Take the lead in the race! Congratulate all of the competitors that put in the effort and participated!<br><br>
The words in bold are verbs. Verbs explain specific acts, such as running, winning, and being fantastic.<br><br>
However, not all verbs refer to literal activities. Nonaction verbs are verbs that refer to sentiments or states of being, such as love and be. Action verbs, on the other hand, are verbs that refer to literal activities.</p>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Adverbs</b>
<p style="color:indianred;"> - An adjective, a verb, or another adverb is described by an adverb. Consider the following examples:<br><br>
Consider the following scenario: I entered the room silently. The phrase "quietly" refers to how you entered (verb) the room.<br><br>
Another illustration: A cheetah is always faster than a lion. The term "always" refers to how often a cheetah is faster (adjective) than a lion.</p>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Prepositions</b>
<p style="color:indianred;"> - The relationship between the other words in a phrase is revealed by prepositions.<br><br>
Consider this scenario: I left my bike sitting against the garage door. The preposition against is used in this sentence because it tells us where I left my bike.
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Conjuctions</b> 
<p style="color:indianred;"> - Conjunctions allow you to construct complicated sentences with many ideas.<br><br>
Marinara sauce is one of my favorites. Alfredo sauce is one of my favorites. Puttanesca sauce is not my favorite. Each of these three statements communicates a distinct notion. There's nothing wrong with making a list of your preferences this way, but it's not the most efficient method.<br><br>Instead, consider this: I enjoy marinara and alfredo sauces, but not Puttanesca.<br><br>The conjunctions and and but are used to connect your concepts in this statement.</p>
<li style="color:indianred;"><b>Articles</b>
<p style="color:indianred;">- A pear. The brick house. An exciting experience. These bolded words are known as articles.<br><br>
Like nouns, articles come in two flavors: definite articles and indefinite articles. And just like the two types of nouns, the type of article you use depends on how specific you need to be about the thing you’re discussing. <br><br> A definite article describes one specific noun, like the and this. Example: Did you buy the car?<br><br>Now swap in an indefinite article: Did you buy a car?<br><br>See how the implication is gone and you’re asking a much more general question?</p>

<h2 style="color:indianred;"> A Little More About Parts of Speech</h2>
<p style="color:indianred;">-It's not always clear which portion of speech a word belongs to. Here are a few simple "hacks" for determining which section of speech you're working with:</p>
<li style="color:indianred;">It's an adverb if it's an adjective with the suffix "-ly." Typical examples include: frequently and swiftly.<br><br>
<li style="color:indianred;">It's a pronoun if you can replace it with a noun and the statement still makes sense. We played basketball, for example. Steve and I used to play basketball together.<br><br>
<li style="color:indianred;">It's a verb if it's something you do and you can change the sentence to add the word do. I have an umbrella, for example. I do, however, have an umbrella.<br><br>
<li style="color:indianred;"> If the sentence still makes sense without the word, but you lose a detail, the word is most likely an adjective. She, for example, drives a red van. She is a van driver.<br><br>
<li style="color:indianred;">It's most certainly a preposition if you can eliminate the word and the phrase still makes sense. I left my notebook on the desk, for example. / I forgot to take my notebook off the desk.<br><br>
<p style="color:indianred;">And if you're ever in a bind, just look up the word. In most dictionaries, a word's entry lists the part of speech it belongs to, and if it belongs to more than one, both are included with examples.<sup>(credits to grammerly)<sup></p>
<h2 style="color:indianred;"> Why Do I Need To Learn This? </h2>
<p style="color:indianred;">Yes, many of us students whine about what we're studying on a daily basis, asking, "Why do we need to learn these in the first place?" or, better yet, "Are we ever going to use this in the real world?"<br>

The answer is actually yes, and I've prepared three reasons to back it up.</p>
<ol>
<li><b> You Can't Make (Or Understand)Sentences Without Them.</b>
<p style="color:indianred;"> Let's imagine your teacher tells you that you're making mistakes with your sentences and that it's affecting your scores. You must first learn what makes a sentence full in order to improve your performance in class. So you go to the dictionary to search up the definition of a complete sentence and come up with the following:<br><br>
A subject and a predicate make up a full sentence. The subject of a sentence is the part of it that is being discussed. The part that says something about the subject is the predicate. The main noun or pronoun that explains what the sentence is about is referred to as the simple subject. The verb or verb phrase that communicates the basic concept about the sentence's subject is referred to as a simple predicate.<br><br>
You can already see the value of knowing your parts of speech if you made it through that paragraph-long definition. You can't figure out what a topic is unless you know what a noun is, which is a person, place, thing, or idea. Furthermore, if you don't know what a verb describes, you'll have a hard time figuring out what a predicate is.</p>
<li><b>It Helps You Master Writing Techniques.</b>
<p> There are ways you may learn to raise your prose and amaze readers if you want to be a better writer. However, learning those strategies is considerably more difficult if you don't know your parts of speech. The usage of parallel structure in writing is a fantastic illustration of this.<br><br>
<b>What Is Parallel Structure?</b>
<p>The usage of recurring grammatical structures in a sentence is known as parallelism. Parallelism is effective because it brings a piece of writing together, produces a rhythm, and draws attention to our words. The closing sentence of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is a classic example:</p>
<em>
"... that our nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not vanish from the world."
</em>
<br>
<p>What struck you about the sentence? I'm guessing that was Abraham Lincoln's parallelism. He utilized a series of prepositional phrases (of the people, by the people, for the people) to emphasize the fragile nature of this new kind of administration that favored the people.</p>
<li><b> It Makes Writing (And Life) Easier.</b>
<p><em>"I could just look this up when I need to know it,"</em> you might think. That's correct; you could. But is that really what you want?<br><br>
Let's take a break from English and use a math analogy to illustrate why knowing parts of speech makes life easier:
<br><br> Assume you have nine lions as pets. You must feed each lion a total of four steaks per day. How many steaks do you eat in a day?<br><br>
You probably quickly realized you'd need thirty-six delicious steaks every day. Perhaps you've decided that owning nine lions is too pricey, and you're considering acquiring a dog instead. Regardless, you didn't have to worry about the math because you've memorized your multiplication (or "times") tables since elementary school. It was simple and automatic. This is why we learn our times tables: it allows us to prepare the table with more time (for our lions).<br><br>
Parts of speech are the basic units of grammar, similar to multiplication tables. Knowing what a verb is off the top of your head will help you recognize if a sentence is lacking a verb; realizing that your first two list items are nouns will help you notice that the list should end with a noun to maintain parallel structure. The more time you spend learning your parts of speech on the front end, the less time you'll spend fixing your mistakes on the back end.<br><br>Learning elements of speech, like anything else, takes time and effort. It is, in my opinion, worth every agonizing sentence in which one must Write the word modified by an adverb or Write the conjunction that appears in each sentence.<sup>(credits to super ela)<sup></p>
